# Homework 1: Code Refactor

## Description

This exercise is to refactor the HTML and CSS of a website to make the code easier to interpret while retaining the same functionality. Optimizations include reducing code redundancy, assigning more appropriate semantic tags, and adding image alt text.

## Usage

The website maintains all the previous functionality as it had prior to refactoring. The nav links should direct users to the appropriate section on the page.
